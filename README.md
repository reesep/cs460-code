# CSCI 460 - Operating Systems!

This is the base "upstream" repository for CSCI 460.

This repository is mostly intended to contain examples from class and serve as an example GitHub repository for students.

## GitHub Setup for Class

To use GitHub effectively in this class we require a rather particular way of setting things up.
In Programming Assignment (PA0) I outlined how you can setup two repositories: one private and one public.
**Your private repo** will be where you check in your solo work (early programming assignments) and for our grading.
**Your public repo** can be used to contribute things back to this class repo.
For more information, please see [Task 8 of PA0](https://www.traviswpeters.com/cs460-2020-fall/pa0/).

## Class Code By The Week

Most weeks we will look at code examples.
These code examples help us practice tools we use, help us to understand how an OS implements something, etc.
Demo code is organized into subdirectories with the prefix `week`. 

## Programming Assignments (PA)

Once you've created your **private repository** based on this repository, you should create separate directories for each solo assignment.
That is, each programming assignment should be kept in its own directory (`/pa0`, `/pa1`, `/pa2`, etc.).
Please do your solo work in the appropriate homework directory.
Remember, **DO NOT PUSH YOUR INDIVIDUAL WORK CODE TO THE PUBLIC REPOSITORY**
