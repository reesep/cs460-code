# PA1 Resources

You should copy/paste any/all of the resources you want to adopt from here into your `pa1/` solution directory.

## What's Here?

- Sample code: `album.c` is a basic C starter program. It uses `readline.c` and `readline.h` to read in a string from the user. You are welcome to use this code as a starting point for your solution.
- A starter `Makefile`. You are welcome to use/adapt this `Makefile` to suit your needs.
- A starter `.gitignore` file. You are welcome to use/adapt this `.gitignore` file to suit your needs.
- `photos/` contains a set of sample images that you can use for developing/testing your album program.
- `sample/` is a directory with sample output material based on a few photos from my solution.
